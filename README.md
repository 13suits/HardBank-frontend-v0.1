# HardBank -- manifesting on-chain commerce. 

This is Version 0.1 of HardBank, built thanks to open-source resources provided by the following:

The Stripes NFT: https://github.com/The-Stripes-NFT/

Techomoro: https://github.com/techomoro/ReactMultiPageWebsite

Thanks a ton, for real.

## Purpose

The purpose of HardBank is to build out the framework which will allow transactions for physical products to be completely represented and executed on the blockchain. This means that both the cryptocurrency that was used to purchase the item, as well as the item itself (more specifically -- a representation of the item) will be recorded on the blockchain.

We define such transactions to be <b>fully on-chain</b> or <b>full-chain</b>. Purchasing an NFT for ETH is an example of a full-chain transaction: the blockchain records both the NFT and the ETH as the two assets are exchanged -- the entire exchange can is represented, in full, on the blockchain.

There are currently many platforms which allow the use of crypocurrency to purchase physical products. In these cases, the transfer of the cryptocurrency from the purchaser's wallet to the merchant's wallet is recorded on the blockchain; however, there is no information as to why the cryptocurrency was transferred. There is no information regarding the product that was bought.


## Available Scripts

We assume that React is already installed on your device, and suggest using Virtual Studio Code.

Per normative standards, the following commands will launch the app in your localhost:3000

### `npm install`
### `npm start`

Additionally, chokidar may be needed to be specifically installed.

At the current duration, the app is meant to be operate on the Rinkeby testnet.

There are three contracts that interact with the front-end:





Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
